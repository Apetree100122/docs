## M. Limited Warranty; Disclaimer

Each Party represents and warrants to the other that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement and each Order Form and SOW is entered into by an employee or agent of such Party with all necessary authority to bind such Party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

_Professional Services Warranty._ Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub's only obligation, and Customer's only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub's option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused prepaid Fees.

_Service Disclaimer._ GitHub provides the Service **“AS IS”** and **“AS AVAILABLE”** without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, GitHub expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet Customer's requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. GitHub will not be responsible for any risk of loss resulting from Customer's downloading and/or use of files, information, Content or other material obtained from the Service.

Beta Previews may not be as reliable or available as the Service. Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. GitHub will have no liability arising out of or in connection with Beta Previews. **Customer uses Beta Previews at its own risk.**

## N. Limitations of Liability

**_Indirect Damages._ To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party be liable to the other party or to any third party for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including for loss of profits, revenue, or data) or for the cost of obtaining substitute products arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, however caused, whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not a party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.**

**_Limitation of Total Liability._ To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party's total cumulative liability under this Agreement from all causes of action and all theories of liability exceed the Fees Customer has actually paid to GitHub during the 12 months preceding the claim giving rise to such liability. For products and services (including use of the Products) that are provided free of charge, GitHub’s liability is limited to direct damages up to $5,000.00 USD. For Beta Previews, GitHub's liability is limited to direct damages up to $500.00 USD.**

**_Exclusions._ The exclusions and limitations set forth in this Section N will not apply to liability arising out of (1) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations in Section P (except for all liability related to Content (excluding GitHub Content), which will remain subject to the limitations and exclusions above) or (2) a Party’s defense obligations in Section O.**

## O. Defense of Claims; Release

The Parties will defend each other against third-party claims, as and to the extent set forth in this Section O and will pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending Party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement of it. The Party being defended must provide the defending Party with all requested assistance, information, and authority. The defending Party will reimburse the other Party for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in providing assistance, and will not settle or make any admissions with respect to a third-party claim without the other Party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This Section O describes the Parties’ sole remedies and entire liability for such claims.

### 1. By GitHub

GitHub will defend Customer against any claim brought by an unaffiliated third party to the extent it alleges Customer’s authorized use of the Service infringes a copyright, patent, or trademark or misappropriates a trade secret of an unaffiliated third party. If GitHub is unable to resolve any such claim under commercially reasonable terms, it may, at its option, either: (a) modify, repair, or replace the Service (as applicable); or (b) terminate Customer’s subscription and refund any prepaid, unused subscription fees. GitHub will have no obligation under this Section O.1 for any such claim arising from: i) the modification of the Service, or the combination, operation, or use of the Service with equipment, devices, software, systems, or data, other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement (including the Documentation); (ii) Customer’s failure to stop using the Service after receiving notice to do so; (iii) Customer’s obligations under Section O.2; (iv) products or services (including use of the Service) that are provided by GitHub free of charge; or (v) access or use of Beta Previews. For purposes of GitHub’s obligation under this Section O.1, the Service includes open source components incorporated by GitHub therein.

### 2. By Customer

Customer will defend GitHub against any claim brought by an unaffiliated third party arising from: (i) Customer Content that Customer uploads to the Service; (ii) Customer's violation of this Agreement, including Customer’s breach of confidentiality or violation of Section C; or (iii) any third party-branded equipment, devices, software, systems, or data that Customer combines, operates, or uses with the Service.

### 3. Disputes with Other Users

If Customer has a dispute with one or more Users, Customer releases GitHub from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

## P. Confidentiality

Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its Representatives who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section P, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section P. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, _provided_ that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement, unless such notice is prohibited by law. The restrictions set forth in this Section P will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

## Q. Professional Services

Upon Customer’s request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide an SOW detailing such Professional Services. GitHub will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine personnel assigned. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains responsible for their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including software, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer while performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the Service.

GitHub will notify Customer of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on the Service or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, Customer's continued use of the Service constitutes agreement to our revisions of this Agreement.
